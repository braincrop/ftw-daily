                What is HotPatch?
              </h2>

              <p>
               Great Question! HotPatch is a peer-to-peer platform for people to list and rent space. We connect businesses and space owners with self-employed and freelance professionals who need access to space. You might say we are the Workspace Marketplace! 
              </p>
              <p>
                HotPatch allows users and hosts to access and share any space: rental chairs in hair salons, fitness studios, offices and anything else in between!
              </p>
