      <h2 id="1-about-the-site-and-these-terms">1. About the site and these terms</h2>
      <p>HotPatch is an online platform that allows you to discover and book workspaces and also offer your workspace to professionals. Please read our Terms of Service (“Services Agreement”) below prior to using our marketplace and it’s services as it governs your use of our platform.</p>
      <p>This HotPatch Services Agreement (“Agreement” or these “Terms”) is a contract between Hotpatch Limited (“HotPatch” or “we”) and the person(s) that are registered with HotPatch (“user” or “you”). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the HotPatch platform to book or list workspaces through our website or apps, and governs your workspace for other users; and establishes the obligations owed between you and HotPatch, and between you and other users.</p>
      <p>Throughout this Agreement, the term “Service” means the service allowing you to book workspace or offer your workspace to others through our website or apps (the “Platform”). The term Service does not include any services provided by third parties. The terms “User” and “Host” refer to the party Booking or Listing a workspace or “Patch”, respectively. Collectively, Users and Hosts of the platform may be referred from time to time as “Members”. </p>
      <p>A “Patch” is the physical space made available to a User to use during specific times, and subject to specific Fees and any site-specific terms or limitations. A Host may “List” a Patch by providing certain details about the Patch including availability, pricing, and terms or limitations of use; this posting about a Patch is called a “Listing.”</p>
      <p>A User may “Book” a Patch by accepting the times, fees, and any additional terms (such as confirmation of all payment conditions between Host and User if required) or limitations of the Listing. A “Booking” is (i) only the grant of a limited, temporary, revocable license to use a Patch subject to all restrictions provided, subject to this Agreement, and as confirmed through the Platform. The scope of the use, including times, specific fees, and other additional terms or limitations, constitutes a “Booking Agreement” that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement and referenced policies. A Booking does not provide you a lease but only allows you limited access to use the Patch or other service only as permitted in the Agreement and, as applicable, the Booking Agreement.</p>
